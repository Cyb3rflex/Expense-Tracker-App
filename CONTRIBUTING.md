## ✅ Code Style

- Use clear variable names (no x, y, data1)

- Keep functions short & focused

- Add comments for tricky logic



---

## 🚫 Don’ts

- Don’t push directly to main branch

- Don’t commit unrelated files (images, personal configs)

- Don’t forget to pull latest changes before working:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

✨ That’s it! Happy coding & collaboration 🎉
